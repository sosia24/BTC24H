              ðŸ“¢ Official Announcement BTC24H<br></br>
              
              Dear BTC24H Community Members
              <br></br>

We are on the verge of a revolutionary milestone that will place our currency in the global spotlight in 2025! With the strength and commitment of each of you, we are launching a strategic market coin-buying operation, using exclusively USDT contributions. This movement will significantly reduce the circulation of coins, increasing their value and solidifying the BTC24H economy.
<br></br>

Why is this operation so special?
<br></br>

ðŸš€Market Strengthening: By reducing the supply of available coins, we ensure a sustainable increase in value.
Connection with Innovation: We are introducing a groundbreaking opportunity with the NFT WBTC, a pioneering system that combines technology with direct benefits for all participants.
Operation Details:
<br></br>

ðŸ’°NFT WBTC - Our Key Feature: An innovative automatic liquidity creator. By purchasing an NFT WBTC, 50% of the invested value will be automatically allocated to creating a WBTC/BTC24H liquidity pool.
Price and Returns:
Each NFT WBTC costs just $250.
Returns are distributed strategically:
20% to a multi-level marketing system spanning 40 levels.
30% to NFTs in special categories (Bronze, Silver, and Gold).
50% allocated to liquidity creation.
Exclusive Benefits:
<br></br>

ðŸ’¡NFTs will be purchased entirely in USDT, and returns will be 100% in WBTC.
The queue-based payment system ensures efficiency: five users ahead and five behind will be paid simultaneously.
Exciting Updates:
<br></br>

ðŸ“ŠStarting today, we will reduce the contribution burn rate from 15% to 5% as a way to honor everyoneâ€™s daily efforts. The remaining 10% will be allocated as a direct referral commission.
A 48-hour window will open for all members to claim at a rate of $0.40 per coin unit.
After this period, all contributions will be 100% in USDT, with payouts made in BTC24H based on the market rate.
Together, we will shape the future!
This is just the first step of a transformative journey. 2025 will be the year BTC24H establishes itself as a global reference, thanks to the unity and tireless work of our community. Get ready for an unprecedented movement that will mark our history!
<br></br>

ðŸ™ŒLetâ€™s move forward, BTC24H! The future is in our hands.
<br></br>

With enthusiasm and dedication,

<br></br>
